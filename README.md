# YT Clipper Chrome Extension

## Background
I take a lot of notes on YouTube videos with a Notion/Logseq page open beside my YouTube player, but often go through the repeatable steps of pausing, switching tabs, recording timestamps and formatting my notes to my liking. I've looked for a good solution to automating this process with a note-taking extension for YouTube but wasn't able to find any so I've decided to program my own solution tailored to my needs.

## Core Functionality
The extension's core functionality includes:
- Storing data about a saved video - Title, Channel, URL, Date of Access
- Providing a button/shortcut for storing video info and opening a pop-up UI over the YouTube website
- Enabling note-taking via GUI that saves details such as a timestamp and note-content
- Displaying the notes that have been taken for a video and providing the option to delete and edit them
- Providing a playback button for each note that brings the video back to the time where that note was taken
- Enabling exporting of those notes in the format that I use for my Notion and Logseq databases


## Future Steps
These are some things that I want to work on in the future
- Enabling custom export templates
- Enabling user profiles with videos/notes that the user has saved
- Integration with Notion to automatically generate pages for the note
- Re-designing UI for better user experience
